## Technical Stacks Used:

## How I Made This
 * I used HTML to make a basic layout, through HTML I define a score board and message to display after the game
 * I used style.css for the basic styling of the website
 * I used javascript for making a working game, With the help of JavaScript I was able to move balloons and was able to increase score, and also I make my background music enabled through JavaScript.
